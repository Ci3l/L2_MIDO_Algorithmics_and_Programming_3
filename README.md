# Algorithmique et Programmation 3 - L2 MIDO

## Course Overview
This repository contains tutorials and exercises from my *Algorithmique et Programmation 3* course at Paris-Dauphine University, where I'm enrolled in the second year of the *Mathematics and Applied Computer Science for Decision-Making* (MIDO) program.

### Instructor
**Denis Cornaz**

### Course Hours
49.5 hours

### Topics Covered
- **Logarithmic Functions**: Recursion and loops involving natural logarithms, plus proofs of basic properties.
- **Asymptotic Notation and Recursive Rounding**: Analyzing algorithm complexity with big-O notation.
- **Complexity and Recursive Relations**: Concepts like `T(n) = aT(n - b) + poly(n)` and their applications.
- **Master Theorem**: Quick proof and applications to algorithms like Karatsuba’s and Strassen’s methods.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Worst-case, average-case, and the use of data structures in sorting.
- **Brute Force Approaches**: Enumeration algorithms for solving equation systems and the n-queens problem.

## Repository Structure
The tutorials are organized sequentially by session, labeled as:
- `tuto_1`
- `tuto_2`
- ...

Each tutorial folder includes Python source code and related documentation or notes.
