# L2_MIDO_Algorithmics_and_Programming_3
This repo contains Python tutorials from the Algorithmique et Programmation 3 course, part of my L2 MIDO studies at Paris-Dauphine University. Topics include logarithmic functions, complexity, the master theorem, sorting, and brute-force methods. Tutorials are organized by session (e.g., tuto_1, tuto_2). Contributions are welcome!
